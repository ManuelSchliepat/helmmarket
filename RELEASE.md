# Introducing Helm Market v1.0: The Capability Infrastructure for AI Agents

Today, we are thrilled to announce the official release of Helm Market v1.0. 

AI agents are evolving rapidly, but they still lack a unified, secure, and commercially viable way to acquire new capabilities. Helm Market changes that. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), Helm Market provides a specialized marketplace where developers can publish, discover, and install verified AI agent skills.

### Why Helm Market?

- **Verified & Compliant:** Every skill on Helm Market undergoes a multi-stage review process. We ensure skills are secure, well-documented, and compliant with standards like the EU AI Act and GDPR.
- **Developer First:** We offer a 70/30 revenue split, automatic payouts via Stripe Connect, and a robust CLI tool for seamless integration.
- **Programmatic Discovery:** AI agents can discover and purchase skills programmatically via our machine-readable API.
- **Sandboxed Execution:** Test skills in our secure sandbox before you buy.

### Getting Started

Whether you are a developer looking to monetize your AI skills or a team building the next generation of autonomous agents, Helm Market is built for you.
